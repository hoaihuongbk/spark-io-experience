**Key Findings and Insights:**

Based on the benchmark results presented above, the following key insights were observed regarding Spark join optimizations:

*   **Default Join Baseline:** A standard (default) join operation serves as a baseline, typically involving significant data shuffling across the network, as indicated by higher elapsed time and shuffle metrics.
*   **Broadcast Join Efficiency:** The Broadcast Join significantly reduced elapsed time to 1 second and executor run time to 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for joining with smaller tables by minimizing shuffle operations (0.002 KB shuffle bytes). This is a substantial improvement over the default join.
*   **Bucketed Join Performance:** The Bucketed Join achieved the lowest elapsed time (1 second) and a very efficient executor run time (1 second), indicating superior performance for join operations when data is pre-organized using bucketing. This optimization minimizes data shuffling and is highly effective for large-scale joins on pre-bucketed data.
