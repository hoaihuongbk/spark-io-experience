**Key Findings and Insights:**

Based on the benchmark results presented above, the following key insights were observed regarding Spark partitioning optimizations:

*   **Partitioned Read vs. Non-Partitioned Read:** Reading from a partitioned table with a filter (`Partitioned Table Read`) resulted in a much lower `Bytes Read` (22.5 KB) compared to the `Non-Partitioned Table Read` (1839.4 KB) for the same filter condition. This highlights the significant I/O efficiency gained through partition pruning. For the non-partitioned read, the higher shuffle read and write (0.460 KB) indicate that data needed to be loaded entirely from storage and then shuffled across workers for filtering, contributing to its less efficient performance despite a lower elapsed time in this specific test case. The drastic reduction in `Bytes Read` for the partitioned table confirms the I/O optimization.
